# Crowns and Kings Game



This Github Repository is primarily for retreiving the results of C And K builds that are released every now and again. If you *really* want to, you can check back here to get some cool things. 


**NOTE** 

*The actual Unity projects are going to also be put in here, but are password protected, so don't waste your time*


Also, mods *will* be supported in the final version.


Thank you for your patience with us, and have a great day.
